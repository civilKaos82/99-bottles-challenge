# 99 Bottles 
 
## Summary 
```text
99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall!

98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer.
Take one down, pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall!

97 bottles of beer on the wall, 97 bottles of beer.
Take one down, pass it around, 96 bottles of beer on the wall!

... and so on...

1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
Take one down, pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall!

*Figure 1*.  Text of the song 99 Bottles of Beer.

Ah, the good old [99 Bottles of Beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99_Bottles_of_Beer) song (see Figure 1).  Are we familiar with the song?  

We're going to model someone singing this song by writing a method which produces the lyrics for the entire song.  We'll write a method `bottle_song`, and in our virtual beer hall, calling `bottle_song(99)` represents asking our rowdy neighbor to start singing 99 Bottles of Beer.

The verses of this song are all very similarâ€”at least, until there's only one bottle of beer on the wall.  As we can imagine, this challenge deals with handling repetition.  

 
##Releases

###Release 0 : Sing it, any number of times

Write a method `bottle_song` which takes as its input a positive integer `n` representing the number of starting bottles in the song.  Pick a reasonable format and print out all the lines to the song.

For example, `bottle_song(500)` starts with the stanza

```text
500 bottles of beer on the wall, 500 bottles of beer.
Take one down, pass it around, 499 bottles of beer on the wall!
```
###Release 1 : Refactor

Now that you have working code, it's time to refactor and DRY it up.  Consider the following: 

* Are there lots of special cases in my code?  Can I isolate those special cases by creating new helper methods?
* Did I pay attention to the fact that the last two stanzas contain "1 bottle of beer" and "no more bottles of beer," respectively?
* If not, can I modify my code to handle those cases without making the code a rat's nest of conditionals?

What other improvements can you make? Find at least 3!

###Release 2 :  Sing it, recursively (Optional)

Write a **recursive** version of `bottle_song` that has the same output as the iterative `bottle_song`.
